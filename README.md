Update 5/29/2025:

This week has been crazy for me, so I didn't make a whole lot of progress. I did brainstorm a few ideas about what I could do for a project, including the documentation note I made in my introduction, and another idea I've just started to play around with that popped into my head yesterday when I thought about my friend, who plays a lot on chess.com. I'm not 50% fleshed out on the details, but it's an idea of mixing something like leetcode with the ranking system that comes from playing others on chess.com, and mixing that with something like mini-hackathon, to help people sharpen their coding skills against others. I'm not sure if it would be better to have a mix of debugging and coding challenges, or just challenges.



The other thing I did this week (tonight, actually) was to go through the GitHub documentation and begin setting up my GitHub page. I've been pretty slow to do any of that this week due to work and some personal family stuff. However, work has been great outside of being a roadblock, because not only have I been forced to learn a new IDE (IntelliJ), I've had to debug in a completely new language (Java, as you can probably guess). Work has been a lot of debugging too, which I really enjoy.



This next week, I plan to flesh out my idea more and explore the documentation and programming challenge space to see what's out there, and set up more of my GitHub page.



My major impediment has been finding time to sit down and do any kind of work - most of the time I don't get to even sit down until around 8:30-9PM at night. I'll need to try and find a better way to balance out my time.
